    - Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with <mark>R</mark> on ~1 million records of transplantations retrieved from the United Network for Organ Sharing database
    - Determined the key factors of different waiting times among less populated, moderately populated and more centralized states by creating heat maps of waitlist patients per capita with <mark>Tableau</mark>
    - Built a prediction model to estimate waiting time with an ideal goodness of fit by fitting data to <mark>JMP</mark> statistical software
    - Evaluated transplant matching ratios by given dates; Results showed that 35.7% of the patients were predicted to match within the first year, and 89% would be matched by their 5th year on the waiting list
    - Proposed an <mark>event tree</mark> to calculate the overall probabilities of transplant success, failure, and failure to match of a given patient
    - Addressed the preceding issues of information asymmetry in the organ donation practice by capturing the dynamic likelihoods and risks in kidney transplants

    - Performed <mark>usability</mark> testing to identify design issues which may cause distracted driving in commonly-used navigation apps
    - Built cognitive models with Cogulator to predict human performance in complex driving scenarios with 95.04% accuracy
    - Established <mark>design principles</mark> for product development based on prediction models and by analyzing actual drivers' physiological data collected from monitoring devices (e.g. Tobii Pro Glasses 2 eye-tracker and GoPro Hero 7)

    - Generated an optimal medical professional work schedule which minimizes the cost of personnel using <mark>linear programming</mark> while meeting all hard constraints (e.g. emergency room capacity, medical resources, maximum working hours for an employee, etc)
    - Conducted <mark>sensitivity analysis</mark> to exploit the informational content of the decision‐support model

    - Identified existing safety issues and <mark>users’ experience</mark> for the drop-off and pick-up systems by working with system operators/users and deploying front-end and task analysis
    - Improved the system’s safety by implementing designated routes for different types of users
    - Proposed the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to perform ID badging task (paring up student(s) and family) to improve systems’ efficiency and shorten system process time
    - Implemented the license plate recognition system to help faculty and staff to operate the systems with a higher level of safety and to save labor costs of security/safety officers
