    The study aimed to predict waitlist times of kidney transplant candidates based on contributing factors of kidney diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, glomerulonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, etc.) using statistical modeling techniques.

    - Performed <mark>exploratory data analysis (EDA)</mark> with <mark>R</mark> on ~1 million transplant candidate records retrived from U.N.O.S database
    - Utilized <mark>Tableau</mark> to created <mark>heat maps</mark> to visualize region-wise waiting times in the U.S.
    - Built a prediction model to estimate waiting time with an ideal goodness of fit by applying data fitting techniques
    - Evaluated transplant matching ratios by given dates; Results showed that 35.7% of the patients were predicted to match within the first 12 months, and 89% would be matched within 5 years
    - Proposed an <mark>event tree</mark> to calculate the overall probabilities of transplant success, failure, and failure to match of a given patient
  #- Addressed the preceding issues of information asymmetry in the organ donation practice by capturing the dynamic likelihoods and risks in kidney transplants

    The pilot research aimed to assess the prevalence of distracted driving while using navigation applications. Real-time physiological data and cognitive modeling techniques were applied to discover how different interface designs would affect human performance.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Performed <mark>usability testing</mark> to identify design issues within navigation apps which may cause distracted driving
    - Built cognitive models with Cogulator to simulate human performance in complex driving scenarios with 95.04% accuracy
    - Established <mark>design principles</mark> for <mark>product development</mark> based on predictions and actual drivers' physiological data collected from monitoring devices

    The project aimed to study the safety and efficiency of a “student transfer” system in a private school at College Station, TX. By analyzing how users were interacting and operating the system under different environmental contexts, we were able to identify the system’s pain points and therefore proposed solutions to improve its safety and efficiency. 
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Identified safety issues and <mark>users’ experiences</mark> of the transfer system by working with system operators and deploying front-end and task analysis
    - Improved the system’s safety by implementing designated routes for different needs
    - Proposed the Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to perform <mark>ID badging task</mark> to improve systems’ efficiency
    - Presented the license plate recognition system to help faculty and staff to operate the systems with a higher level of safety while saving labor costs

    A mathematical model was built using linear programming to design an optimal work schedule for emergency room healthcare professionals in the hope of shortening ER queues while minimizing labor costs.
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    - Designed an optimal medical professional work schedule which minimized the cost of personnel using <mark>linear programming</mark> while meeting all hard constraints (e.g. room capacity, medical resources, maximum working hours, etc)
    - Conducted <mark>sensitivity analysis</mark> to exploit the informational content of the decision‐support model
